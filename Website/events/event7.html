        <p id="head">Cosmic Consciousness Conference</p>
        <p id="subtitle"> Tuesday 10:00 AM - 13:00 PM</p>
        <p class="desc"> What is Cosmic Consciousness?
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
        We are so used to assigning consciousness only to human thought that it takes some adjustment to see it as universal, or cosmic, applying at all levels. But the label applied to mystics, saints, and sages, both East and West, really denotes those who have escaped the limitations of everyday perception. Their experiences supply abundant evidence—thousands of years’ worth—that the mind can look at itself and experience what consciousness is.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
        If you strip away all religious associations, higher consciousness is observational and experiential; the mind looks directly at itself rather than outward at things. Things constitute Maya in the Indian tradition, a word somewhat misleadingly translated as “illusion” but which works better if understood as “appearance” or “distraction.” It also implies impermanence. The world “out there” appears to be self-sustained, distracting us from the truth: Without consciousness, nothing is experienced, either “in here” or “out there.”
        </p>
        <p class="desc">This 3-day conference will take place at an amazing resort and you shouldn’t miss it!  The flagship event of International Earth Chakra Day will host speakers who are world-leaders in areas of consciousness. A full and exciting program including specialist workshops, cultural tours, film and documentary screenings and sky watching, meditations and activities will make the weekend an extraordinary experience. This event will be held on Tuesday at 10:00 AM and it will conclude at 13:00 PM.</p>
