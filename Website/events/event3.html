        <p id="head">Meditation Workshop</p>
        <p id="subtitle"> Tuesday 10:00 AM - Thursday 13:00 PM</p>
        <p class="desc"> Meditation is a powerful technique for developing a peaceful mind and inner good qualities. The meditation workshops provide quality meditation with clear explanations of the skills required to create stillness within, but are shorter and lighter than our day courses. A meditation workshop consists of two sessions that include guided meditations, explanation, and discussion. The emphasis is on practicing meditation and applying the experience we gain from it to improve the quality of our life. The workshop will begin next week on Tuesday and it will end on Thursday. There will be one session every day at 10:00 PM, each will take 3 hours.
