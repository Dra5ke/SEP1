        <p class="desc"> Karma and reincarnation are inseparable and it’s not possible to adequately discuss one without the other. Karma is a Divine all-pervasive law. It is a natural law – just like gravity is a natural law. It is not about punishment, and certainly not about vengeance. It is perfectly exact, just and fair and applies to everything and everyone in creation. It can be speeded up, and slowed down – but never avoided; hence it is sometimes termed the law of inevitability. In essence it is Divine simplicity itself – but its manifestations can be highly complex.

        <p class="desc">Karma and reincarnation are inseparable and reincarnation is a logical consequence of karma. When someone dies, they will not have worked out all their karma. What has been “sown”, will not all have been “reaped”, and there will not have been an “opposite and equal” reaction to their every thought and action. Therefore, logically speaking, although they have left their body, they cannot cease to exist. They have to come back.</p>
        <p class="desc">This event is a seminar on Reincarnation and Karma from the point of view of modern scientific thought. The Hindu lecturer Sanvi Rajewali will present the concepts of reincarnation and karma using scientific theories as a basis for discussion. The seminar will be split into 2 parts that take 2 hours each. The first part will be mainly focused on reincarnation and the other on karma. This event will be held on Saturday at 14:00 PM and it will conclude at 16:00 PM.</p>
