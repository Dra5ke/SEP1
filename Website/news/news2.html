        <p id="head">Why Buddhism?</p>
        <p id="subtitle">The question many people ask us</p>
        <p class="desc">Buddhism has been around for over 2,500 years and is a way of life that about 300million people around the world follow. At the age of 35, Gautama left the palace walls where he had grown up and ventured into the real world to walk his own spiritual path. Sitting under a Bodhi tree until he became enlightened, ‘Buddha’ attracted a following and dedicated the rest of his life teaching the path of enlightenment and awakening to them. Buddhism is a very calm, peaceful and fair way of life and these Buddha quotes encompass the philosophy of Buddha’s teachings.
